# Loan Lending Club Case Study
> This case study aims at finding the risky candidates for loans. As a result, it is possible to minimize the number of loans permitted that could potentially default thus decreasing credit loss rates. This will be achieved by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the provided dataset.

By spotting these risky loan applicants, we can bring down credit losses by far much more. This case study is designed to reduce credit loss.

The firm in other words wants to know what drives loan default through driver variables. These are variables which have a huge possibility of leading to defaulter sship. By doing this, it will enable the company to make informed decisions about its portfolio and risk assessment and hence make better lending decisions.

## General Information
 ### Objective: 
   Early identification of potential loan defaulters to aid lending companies in decisions.
 ### Dataset: 
   The Lending Club dataset that has information on customer loan details.
 ### Background: 
   Many of the earnings accruing to banking do stem from interest earned on home loans or different credit lines. However, bad loans or borrowers who default can have a profound effect on profitability.
  
  Challenges:
   The loan approval process is complex, involving assessments of innumerable numbers of aspects of applications, all being evaluated by humans, since no machine could take on such a sensitive and creative   assignment. This process is labor-intensive and prone to errors and biases of humans.
 ### Business Problem:
   The main objective is to pinpoint potential defaulters basend on their application data which has been provided.
   
 ### Key Challenges:
   - Which type of applicants are most likely to default on their credit line?
   - Different crietrias to be considered during the loan approval process ?
